        <h1>About the Green Bangle Movement</h1>
        <p style="max-width: 650px;">
          Green Bangle Movement (GBM) was born out of a simple question: what if
          coastal protection, women’s work and climate education could be woven
          into the same circle? Starting from a university campus and spreading
          into nearby coastal areas, GBM brings students, women and local leaders
          together around nurseries, mangroves and palmyra palms.
        </p>
        <p style="max-width: 650px;">
          The “bangle” in our name carries memory — of women’s hands, shared labour
          and everyday strength. Our green bangles are living ones: rings of trees,
          shorelines of care, and networks of women who hold communities through
          uncertainty.

              The journey began with joy, colour and community spirit. The Palmyra Fruit Festival
              at AUW created a bridge between environmental knowledge and cultural celebration.
              Students, faculty and mentors came together to reconnect with indigenous plants,
              traditional uses and the importance of protecting local biodiversity.
